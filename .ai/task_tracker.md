## Completed Tasks

### 2026-04-23 - Create repo-local AI workflow system

- Status: Done
- Request: Create a minimal `.ai/` context system for repeatable AI-assisted development.
- Files inspected: `Cargo.toml`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.vscode/README.md`, `.vscode/tasks.json`, `.vscode/launch.json`, `.vscode/settings.json`, `.vscode/extensions.json`, `src/main.rs`, `src/lib.rs`, `src/app.rs`, `src/types.rs`, `src/timeline.rs`, `src/selection.rs`, `src/export.rs`, `src/project.rs`, `src/runtime.rs`, `src/thumbnail.rs`, `.gitignore`
- Files changed: `.ai/agent.md`, `.ai/repo_overview.md`, `.ai/architecture.md`, `.ai/workflows.md`, `.ai/task_tracker.md`, `AGENTS.md`
- Verification: Documentation-only change; verified by file inspection and `git status --short`.
- Notes: Existing `src/app.rs` had uncommitted changes before this task and was not modified.

## Parking Lot

- Consider adding automated GTK smoke or interaction tests if the project later adopts a GUI testing strategy.
- Consider documenting project JSON schema/versioning if saved-project compatibility becomes important.
